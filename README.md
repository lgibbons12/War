# War!

This is the first big coding project I put my hands on. I was a junior trying to get into a senior only class, so I had to prove myself by creating a card game. I chose war, and used a package in python called pygame to run it. It is 99% functional, only including a couple bugs when there are multiple wars in a row, and includes a title and end screen with restarting possible. I spent a lot of time on it and am really proud of it as my first venture into coding.
